CS Senior Project - CollegeThrift
Spring Semester Week 10 Update - March 26
Advisor: Prof. E. Syta

Completed Task:
1. Complete ElasticSeach Setup with Firebase Cloud Functions
- The Elastic Search Setup is complete which allows for searching listings robustly in various ways.
2. Firebase Cloud Messaging Infrastructure Setup and Creation of Messages Class
- I have attached Firebase Cloud Messaging Interface to the app and created classes for this feature.
 I also designed the messaging schema and queries. The general layout scaffolding and classes are also built. Need to add methods to send and receive messages to make it functional.

Outstanding Tasks:
None from projected work from the last meeting (Target is to complete messaging infrastructure by this week)

Challenges:
The Email sending infrastructure of the app seems to have stopped working. The code seems fine. I did tests by adding onCompleteListeners and onFailureListeners and it shows SUCCESSFUL on the app. However, the email is not being sent. Need to see if its a Firebase Issue or the code issue.

Upcoming Tasks:
1. Complete the messaging infrastructure
2. Add Favorite feature
