Week 6
Advisor: Prof. E. Syta

Update:
1. Firebase Integration
- After repeatedly trying to make Amazon DynamoDB integration work and failing
I decided to try Firebase instead. It took some time to get used to and learn 
its different components, in addition to few attempts on dummy projects to make
it work. In the end, it was very straight-forward and was easily integrated from
android studio and looks very simple.

2. Schema Design and Firebase Databse
- I took some time learning about best practices in designing database in Firebase
and also learning how query operations work. Then, I designed a database schema
for the project. For now, I only have tables for users and listings(posts). The
schema for chat and transactions will be made in the spring semester because
those functionalities are schedule for then. The schema is in the file named
"collegeTHriftSchema.txt" in this folder.

3. Create Listings and View Listings Page
- The View Listings Page (the main entry page where all the posts can be seen)
and Create Listings Page (the page where users can make posts) are functional
and are connected to the databse. However, these posts do not contain images yet
as I am working on storing images on Firebase Storage and linking them to the posts.
